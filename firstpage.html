              <p>I am a 5 year old Brussels Griffon from Hermeston Oregon. My family adopted me in March 2012. We lived in San Francisco, California for a few years and I got to meet a lot of dogs. There was this one time I escaped from my dog walker and ran the city for one night. My family was so worried, but this man found me and took me in for the evening. I ran away to look for my family who was out of town. After that adventure, I get to fly on airplanes for family vacations. I love it!
              </p>
              <p>In 2012 I met my best friend Alfonso Bendat at Miscone Park in SF. His family is really nice, and gets me. I spent a lot of time at their house chasing Alfonso and lounging on their many couches. Alfonso and I had a competition to see who could hide the pee spots on the rug. I won most of the time. #Winning!
              </p>
              <p>In 2014, my family moved away from the city to a town 9 hours away by car, called Solana Beach, California. Now I don't get too see Alfonso much anymore. I miss him and his beard. AND I also miss his family who cared for me when mom and dad were busy.
              </p>
              <p>The highlight of my life has been my family. They love and care for me so much, but my mom is a bit of a smotherer. My dad ignores me most of the time, and somehow we find a happy medium. Sometimes I like to sit between then to interrupt their conversations. They get thrown off so much!
              </p>
              <p>The biggest change this year has been my dog walkers. They are all crazy, and only a handful of them actually do what my mom asks. My favorite dog walker is Rachael. She is sweet. Plus, she lives in Del Mar, and has an ocean view. Sick!
